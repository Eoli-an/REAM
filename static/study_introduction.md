Hello there! Thank you for your interest in trying out REAM, the app that streamlines learning to read Chinese. Don't worry if you never studied Chinese before, the app will guide you through all necessary steps. The main page of REAM is located at https://ream-six.vercel.app/. It is recommended that you use the app with Wifi.

To participate in the study, please follow these instructions:

1. _1. Read the Tutorial._ You can either navigate to the Blogs from the main page, or go directly there https://ream-six.vercel.app/blog/tutorial
2. _2. Create an account._ Choose "get started" from the main page and create an account. As E-mail, use username@ream.com, where you can replace username with a name that you like. Also choose a password.
3. _3. Use the app for ~30 min._ After registering, you will be navigated to /upload. From here, you can select texts that you can read. Please start with reading tortoise_hare and park_short_story. After that, feel free to read the gpt_gen texts, though this is not mandatory. Furthermore, please explore the features of the app, as demonstrated in the tutorial. You can click on characters, words and explanations and also open up additional screens.

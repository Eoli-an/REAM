# Introduction

REAM is a platoform tht supports you to read chinese text. As a language learner, this enables you to read more complicated and thus more enganging text that your current level would usually permit.

# Background on written Chinese

For those of you that don't know any Chinese yet, let's dive right in with a short explanation about the written Chinese language.

Consider the following Chinese sentence:

我喜欢绿茶.

Each component in this sentence is called a character (think of it as a squibbly square for now). For instance, 我 is the character that means "I" and 茶 means "tea".

Words in Chinese are made out of one or more characters. The character 喜 means "to be fond of", the character 欢 means "joyous". Together, they make up the word 喜欢 meaning "to like". It can be thought of as meaning "to be joyously fond of something". The character 我 (I) is a word in itself.

Together, the sentence means

我(I)喜欢(like)绿(green)茶(tea).

That is the gist of a Chinese sentence. Characters make up words and words make up sentences. The grammar to combine the words is often a lot easier than in English.

Now, of course the characters are not only squibly squares. They also are made up of meaningful components (also called radicals) that make recognizing and memorizing characters easier.

For instance, the character 我 is composed of the components 手 (hand) and 戈 (spear). Why would hand and spear together point to the meaning "I"? Well there is a lot to be discussed here, but for our purposes we can say that this is completly random.
茶(tea) is composed of the components 艹 (grass), 人 (human), 十 (ten), and 小 (small). Even though the combinations might be random, knowing that characters are composed of components makes them a lot easier to learn as we see later.

In conclusion, compoents make up characters, characters make up words and words make up sentences. You need to know about 200 compoents, 3000 characters, 6000 words and a bit of grammar to read Chinese on a native level.

# REAM

That's quite a lot to learn until you can read texts that interest you. Fortunatly, REAM supports you at each step on this pipleline, enabling you to read engaging texts much sooner on your journey.
The step components -> character is supported by introducing you to mnemonics/memory techniques to significtaly reduce the time you have to spend memorizing.
By replacing characters with images the step characters -> words can be
Finally, the step words -> sentence is supported by using AI-generated simplifications and explanations, making the sentence strucutre easier to understand.

# Scaffolds

When learning to read chinese, knowing a lot of characters and words is a prerequisite for understanding complicated text. This means that it takes a long time to get to actually engaging and interesting readings. However, in REAM there is so much support given that even beginners can already read text that they are interested in. Think of it like a pop-up dictonary on steroids.
This means that you will spend a lot more time actually reading. Gradually, the scaffolds will be removed and the text will become more and more authentic. In the long run, the need o use REAM will vansih and you'll just be able to any text of your choosing.
REAM gives you the power of noumeros support systems:

# Image Scaffolds

One of the biggest aspects of learning to read Chinese is familiarity with a lot of characters. Only after is it possible to understand words and sentences. However, in REAM this step can be partially skipped. In REAM, there exists a unique image for each Chinese character which represents the meaning of the character. When you read a text, the characters that you don't yet know are replaced with their respective images. For instance, suppose you encounter the the unknown character 米 (rice) in a text that you are reading. Instead of showing you the character, REAM will replace the character with an image of a bowl of rice. Thus, for the time being, you will not need to remember that 米 means rice. Instead you will only need to remember that the image of a bowl of rice is supposed to represent "rice". During this period, you will gain familiarity with the character for instance in which word it occurs or in which part of the sentence it is often used. Learning the image -> meaning association is a lot easier than learning the character -> meaning association and thus your understanding will be a lot swifter. Once you feel ready to learn the actual character, REAM will also help you with that via Mnemonics.

# Mnemonics to learn characters easily

Mnemonics are techniques that "hack" the brain to remember information a lot easier. In REAM, Mnemonics are used to remember the meaning of a character, given the meanings of their components. Take for instance the character 家 which means home/family. The character is composed of the components 宀 (roof) and 豕 (pig). To remember the meaning, in REAM those components are combined in a short memorable story/picture that point to the meaning of the character. For 家 this could mean imagining a family of pigs standing below the roof of their hut during rain.
Those types of images are a lot easier to learn than just rote memorizing the character shape itself. In REAM, we generated those mnemonic images for you and you can gradually introduce them during your readings.

Image scaffolds and Mnemonics are the bread and butter of REAM and will help you progress a lot quicker on your journey to learn Chinese. To further make engaging text more accessible, in REAM you also have the oppurtunity to use AI-generated tools such as simplification and explanations.

# Simplification

REAM uses modern large language models to simplify text that you upload. This means you have the advantge of less complicated grammar and words while still being able to read your favorite stories or articles. The simplification is REAM is fine-tuned to strike a good balance between retaining most information and make the languge simpler to understand.

# Explanation

In REAM, you also have the opportunity to look at large language model generated explanations of characters and words. For instance, REAM can help you understand why some characters together for a particular word or what the meaning and purpose of a word is in the particular context.

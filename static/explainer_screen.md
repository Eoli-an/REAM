## _Introduction_

REAM is a platform that supports you in reading Chinese text. As a language learner, this enables you to read more complicated and thus more engaging text than your current level would usually permit.

## _Background on written Chinese_

For those of you who don't know any Chinese yet, let's dive right in with a short explanation of the written Chinese language.
Consider the following Chinese sentence:

我喜欢绿茶.

Each component in this sentence is called a character (think of it as a squiggly square for now). For instance, 我 is the character that means "I" and 茶 means "tea".

Words in Chinese are made out of one or more characters. The character 喜 means "to be fond of", the character 欢 means "joyous". Together, they make up the word 喜欢 meaning "to like". It can be thought of as meaning "to be joyously fond of something". The character 我 (I) is a word in itself.
Together, the sentence means

我(I) 喜欢(like) 绿(green) 茶(tea).

That is the gist of a Chinese sentence. Characters make up words and words make up sentences. The grammar to combine the words is often a lot easier than in English.

Of course, the characters are not only squiggly squares. They also are made up of meaningful components (also called radicals) that make recognizing and memorizing characters easier.

For instance, the character 我 is composed of the components 手 (hand) and 戈 (spear). Why would hand and spear together point to the meaning "I"? Well, there is a lot to be discussed here, but for our purpose we can say that this is completely random.
茶(tea) is composed of the components 艹 (grass), 人 (human), 十 (ten), and 小 (small). Even though the combinations might be random, knowing that characters are composed of components makes them a lot easier to learn as we see later.

In conclusion, components make up characters, characters make up words and words make up sentences. You need to know about 200 components, 3000 characters, 6000 words and a bit of grammar to read Chinese on a native level.

## _REAM_

That's quite a lot to learn until you can read texts that interest you. Fortunately, REAM supports you at each step of this pipeline, enabling you to read engaging texts much sooner on your journey. Think of it like a pop-up dictionary on steroids.

REAM has three components:

### _Image Scaffolds_

In REAM, characters can be replaced with images. Thus the memorization of that character can be essentially skipped, which allows for rapid progression in text comprehension.

### _Mnemonics_

Mnemonics (memorization techniques) are used to help with learning the characters from their components.

### _AI-helpers_

REAM utilizes modern AI to give you a hand with all other aspects of reading. The AI generates explanations, simplifies texts and provides you with context-aware translations.

In the following, I will describe each of the three characteristics of REAM in detail such that you can use them with confidence!

<!-- When learning to read chinese, knowing a lot of characters and words is a prerequisite for understanding complicated text. However, memorizing characters is time consuming even with Mnemonics and this means that it takes a long time to get to actually engaging and interesting readings. However, in REAM there is so much support given that even beginners can already read text that they are interested in. Think of it like a pop-up dictionary on steroids.
This means that you will spend a lot more time actually reading. Gradually, the scaffolds will be removed and the text will become more and more authentic. In the long run, the need o use REAM will vanish and you'll just be able to any text of your choosing.
REAM gives you the power of numerous support systems: -->

## _Image Scaffolds_

Historically, many characters evolved from actual drawings of the things they represented. For instance, the character 目, which means eye, evolved from a drawing of an eye.

![Chinese Path](/eye_evolution.png)

At some point during the evolution of their language, the Chinese people must have figured out that they really suck at drawing and instead resorted to inventing an abstract symbol system (the real story might be slightly more complicated). However, with the capabilities of modern image generation AI, we can bring the Chinese language back to its roots.

For each character, REAM lets you choose an image to replace it with. Have a look at the following examples:

![Chinese Path](/ImageExamples.png)

乌 means black/crow depending on context. In REAM, this character is replaced with an image of a black crow (as an additional hint, the word "black" is also embedded in the image). When this character shows up while reading a text, it will be replaced by the image. So instead of needing to remember the meaning of the character from the squiggly lines, you only have to remember the meaning of the image. Sometimes, like in the second example, the meaning is more abstract and/or the character might have many multiple meanings depending on the context. 很 means "very" and in the image this is visualized with a very large insect.

Of course, if the characters are replaced with an image, you will not learn the character -> meaning association. However, what you can do is skip the process for a while and during that time read more engaging texts. Furthermore, you will also get familiar with the character, for instance in which words or context it is used.

<!-- One of the biggest aspects of learning to read Chinese is familiarity with a lot of characters. Only after is it possible to understand words and sentences. However, in REAM this step can be partially skipped. In REAM, there exists a unique image for each Chinese character which represents the meaning of the character. When you read a text, the characters that you don't yet know are replaced with their respective images. For instance, suppose you encounter the the unknown character 米 (rice) in a text that you are reading. Instead of showing you the character, REAM will replace the character with an image of a bowl of rice. Thus, for the time being, you will not need to remember that 米 means rice. Instead you will only need to remember that the image of a bowl of rice is supposed to represent "rice". During this period, you will gain familiarity with the character for instance in which word it occurs or in which part of the sentence it is often used. Learning the image -> meaning association is a lot easier than learning the character -> meaning association and thus your understanding will be a lot swifter. Once you feel ready to learn the actual character, REAM will also help you with that via Mnemonics. -->

## _Mnemonics_

Once you feel like you have familiarized yourself enough with how a character is used, you can proceed to memorize it. REAM helps you with this step by introducing mnemonics. Mnemonics are techniques that "hack" the brain to remember information a lot easier. In REAM, mnemonics are used to remember the meaning of a character, given the meanings of their components. Take for instance the character 是 which means be/is. The character is composed of the components 日 (sun/day), 一 (one), 龰 (foot). To remember the meaning, in REAM those components are combined in a short memorable story/picture that point to the meaning of the character. For 是 we can draw a picture of a sun at the top and feet in the lower part of the image. If we combine this with beach/relaxing vibes this points to the meaning be (just relaxing/being, in contrast to doing anything).

Those types of images are a lot easier to learn than just rote memorizing the character shape itself. In REAM, we generated those mnemonic images for you and you can gradually introduce them during your readings. Right now, the usage of Mnemonics is limited because a) there are not a lot of Mnemonics available yet and b) you first have to learn the meaning of the ~200 most common components. In the future, REAM will also show you the meaning of the characters automatically, like the second part in the image above.

## _AI-helpers_

Image scaffolds and Mnemonics are the bread and butter of REAM and will help you progress a lot quicker on your journey to learn Chinese. To further make engaging text more accessible, in REAM you also have the opportunity to use AI-generated tools such as simplification and explanations.

REAM uses modern large language models to simplify text that you upload. This means you have the advantage of less complicated grammar and words while still being able to read your favorite stories or articles. The simplification is REAM is fine-tuned to strike a good balance between retaining most information and make the language simpler to understand. The simplification is accessible via a sidepanel that you can open in the top right corner.

Furthermore, you also have the opportunity to look at large language model generated explanations of characters and words. For instance, REAM can help you understand why some characters together for a particular word or what the meaning and purpose of a word is in the particular context. Those explanations are available via clicking a character or a word.

Lastly, you also have the opportunity to access AI-generated translations of individual words and a whole sentence. To translate a whole sentence, click on the three dots at the top of the screen. To access AI-generated translations click on the dots above a word. The word translations are adaptive, such that the translation fits the current context best.

## _Learning progress_

As you progress in learning Chinese, you will need to rely less and less on the scaffolds that the app provides. It is encouraged to remove a scaffold such as the word translation or the Mnemonic once you feel like you have a good grasp on the item. In the future, I plan to include a procedure that automatically removes the scaffolds for you at an appropriate time.

## _More Texts_

In the app, you'll see a few pre-uploaded texts to choose from. If you want to continue using the app after reading those texts, you can upload your own in a .txt file. You may either upload Chinese text or you may upload English text which will be translated automatically. Furthermore, you can also go to ChatGPT and ask it to generate text for you that is exactly at your vocabulary level and that matches your taste. In the future, this will be available directly in the app.

## _Conclusion_

With REAM, your written Chinese language learning journey is stREAMlined. It is designed to give you just the right information that you need at a time to understand text, making for a smooth journey. I hope you enjoy the app!
